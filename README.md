# Users-API
This project is the API of the users application built with Springboot.

# Why this project?
For a learning purpose.

# How to run the app?

**Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17:** The application is configured to use Java 17, so you need to have JDK 17 installed on your system.

**Spring Boot:** Since this is a Spring Boot project, you need to install the necessary Spring Boot dependencies to run the application. These dependencies will be handled automatically via Maven when you compile and run the project, so there's no need to install them manually.

**Compile and run the project:** Now your database will be running.

If you want you can also use an application like Postman to see how the data is created when adding or deleting users.

The default path for making requests is localhost:8080/users

# How to run the app?

You can find the App repository [here](https://github.com/adlopp/users-app)

You will need npm, the default package management system for Node.js, a runtime environment for JavaScript.

To install npm, execute the following commands.

1. **$cd <directory_project>**
2. **$npm install**

Once all the dependencies are installed, the person can run the project using the scripts defined in the package.json file.

3. **$npm run dev**
This will open the web application in your browser but you will need to have the API of the application running in order to get the data from the database.
